# Battleship
A game of Battleship coded in C++ using polymorphism and recursion.

There are 4 options when the program is run,
  1.  A mini-game between two mediocre players
  2.  A mediocre player against a human player
  3.  A 10-game match between a mediocre and an awful player, with no pauses
  4.  A human player against a human player

Simply choose whichever option you'd like by typing in the number. After that, the game explains the rest of the directions for the game.
